For now, this space will be fairly empty, but at some point, I'll add an overview here of past and current projects I'm working on! Not sure what else I'll do with this file (not exactly looking to make this a copy of my LinkedIn page), but we'll see.

Shoutout to [@FRC-Team-1160](https://github.com/FRC-Team-1160), where I worked on a number of robots during high school and made various code contributions (usually under a local user account).
